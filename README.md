# ML_powered_DNS_caching
This is a ML powered DNS caching scheme as mentioned in the paper "Exploring Domain Name Based Features
on the Effectiveness of DNS Caching". The ML model is a feed forward neural net clasifier instead of the random forest clasifier as mentioned in the paper.

# Training the model.
Create a folder called 'model'. Make sure to install all the necessary dependencies including pytorch, pandas and sklearn. This can be installed using pip or conda. You can then train the classifier using the train.py file.
The command for running it is 
```python train.py```
